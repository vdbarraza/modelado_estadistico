Each character has its own distinctive dance and also a specific sound, and most episodes end with the characters dancing. Many episodes also involve parties.

Each writer was asked to visualize the future and write a story, something rather personal. As Yaraqa read through their reflections, it reached out to a select group of professional dancers and asked them to respond to the text they'd received with movement and dance. In their personal spaces, every dancer embodied the text and filmed their work with a mobile phone. Yaraqa then took the text and footage, pieced them together, curated narration and music to create 8 home-based short films around one central theme. The episodes depict a range of emotions and gently remind us that in times of extreme uncertainty a basic human need emerges, that of re-imagining the future.",2021,"TV-PG",4,"[]","[]",1,"tt14754320",NA,NA
